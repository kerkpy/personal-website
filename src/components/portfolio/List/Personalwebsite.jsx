                <p>This personal website began as a self-directed project to learn React and Sass.</p>

                <br/> 

                <p>I thought that it would be a fun and useful project to introduce myself to others given that I am relatively shy.</p>

                <br/> 

                <p>In the process of developing this website, I have no doubt learnt much. It is no doubt always a work in progress.</p>
