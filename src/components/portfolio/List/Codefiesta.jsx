                <p>CodeFiesta 2021 was the first hackathon that I had participated in. </p>

                <br/> 

                <p>
                As part of the challenge, we had to design a solution and create a prototype of it, to address 
                    the issues faced by Overseas Singaporeans. 
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    The main issue identified by my team was that Overseas Singaporeans generally lack social support.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    Thus, the proposed solution is a platform that connect overseas Singaporeans with other overseas Singaporeans, through interests and proximity.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p> The emphasis of the hackathon was on the design process. Primarily, the solution proposed should address a genuine concern. A key takeaway is that complexity may occasionally be a distraction.</p>

                <br/> 

                <p>My team was part of the finalist (Top 6 out of 90+ teams) in this hackathon. Overall, it is a satisfying experience and a project I am particularly proud of.</p>
