                <p>The app is a chatbot that was created from scratch using Java for a Software Engineering module. </p>

                <br/> 

                <p>It has been affectionately named "Sponge and Bob".</p>

                <br/>

                <p>There is an emphasis on coding style and legibility of the code written. I also learnt Object-Orientated Programming from this project.

                </p>

                <p>Given that it is the first application that I have built that is substantial, it does have some significance to me.
                    I had built something that I thought looked silly, but I had fun in the process.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>In a way, the project made me feel that regardless of what you are doing, it's important to find the opportunity to see the fun side of things. </p>

                <br/> 

                <p>There's also great joy in creating something from *nothing*</p>
