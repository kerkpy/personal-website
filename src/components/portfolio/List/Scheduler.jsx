                <p>A project that I worked on in school as part of the Software Engineering Module that I had taken.</p>

                <br/> 

                <p>A brownfield project, it is the first time that I had developed a preexisting application in a team.</p>

                <br/> 

                <p>The app is an enhancement of an Address Book app. It is intended to be a scheduler that helps a coach (me, previously) schedule trainings with his/her athletes given 
                    the different conflicting schedules that they might have.
                </p>

                <br/> 

                <p> The project is completed in Java. Beyond the technical challenges, there is also a strong emphasis placed on adhering to coding style, unit testing, design principles, documentation and project management. 
                </p>

                <br/>
                
                <p>While challenging, it was a good experience nonetheless as it exposed me to some of the challenges related to software engineering.
